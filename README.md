# manager_firing

The numerical approaches discussed in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of 'Firing an External Manager' were modelled and visualized with Python. 
This code, along with relevant documentation, can be accessed through this repository. Readers can examine 
the implementation details, gain insights into the computational workflow, and experiment with the code to replicate the 
results of the research.

Arranged by the specific numerical approaches discussed in the sections above, documented code includes the implementation
of the relevant formulas and the visualization routines. By sharing the code and associated resources, we aim to foster transparency,
reproducibility, and collaboration within the scientific and finance community. We believe that the availability of this codebase 
will also serve as a valuable resource for future research and comparative analyses.

To run the program:
- Navigate to main.py and click the Run button.
- There is no output while calculations are taking place. Please wait!
- Once the computations are finished, visualizations appear on a separate pop-up tab.
